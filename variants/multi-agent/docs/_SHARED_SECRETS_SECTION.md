## Secrets & Token Locations

GateForge separates secrets by owner and lifetime. You MUST read and write tokens only at the locations listed below. Do not create ad-hoc `.env` files elsewhere, and do not inline secrets in commits, prompts, or logs.

| Secret Class | Location | Permissions | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GateForge platform tokens** (HMAC, gateway, hook tokens, Architect URL, Tailscale auth) | `/opt/secrets/gateforge.env` | `root:root` · `0600` | Host / systemd only |
| **GitHub tokens** (fine-grained PATs, machine-user tokens) | `~/.config/gateforge/github-tokens.env` | `$USER:$USER` · `0600` | OpenClaw agent user |
| **All other application tokens** (LLM provider keys, MiniMax, Brave Search, Telegram, 3rd-party SaaS) | `~/.config/gateforge/<app>.env` (one file per app, e.g. `anthropic.env`, `minimax.env`, `telegram.env`, `brave.env`) | `$USER:$USER` · `0600` | OpenClaw agent user |

### Loading order

1. The systemd service for the OpenClaw gateway sources `/opt/secrets/gateforge.env` at start.
2. The agent user's shell profile sources every file under `~/.config/gateforge/*.env`.
3. `openclaw.json` references variables by name (e.g. `${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}`); resolution follows shell environment first, then the gateway's EnvironmentFile.

### Rules for agents

- **Never print a secret.** Treat any value loaded from these paths as opaque. Do not echo, log, or commit it.
- **Never copy secrets into task payloads.** Reference them by env-var name; the host resolves the value.
- **Never write to `/opt/secrets/gateforge.env`.** It is managed exclusively by `install/setup-vmN-*.sh`.
- **When a new third-party token is needed**, request it via an `[INFO]` notification with a proposed filename (`~/.config/gateforge/<app>.env`) and the env-var names required. The Architect and human operator provision it.
- **When in doubt about where a token lives**, check this table. If a path is not listed, the token does not exist yet — request it, do not invent a location.

### Host-side notifier (spokes only: VM-2, VM-3, VM-4, VM-5)

The `gf-notify-architect` systemd service reads `/opt/secrets/gateforge.env` directly. The agent does NOT need `AGENT_SECRET`, `ARCHITECT_HOOK_TOKEN`, or `ARCHITECT_NOTIFY_URL` in its own environment — they are kept off the LLM's context deliberately.
