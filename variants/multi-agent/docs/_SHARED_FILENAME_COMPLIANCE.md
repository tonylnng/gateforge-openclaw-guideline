### Filename and Path Compliance (mandatory)

When a task payload specifies an exact value for any of the following fields, you MUST use the value **verbatim**:

- `filename`
- `path`
- `branch`
- `commitSubject`
- `outputPath`
- any field ending in `_file`, `_path`, or `_branch`

You MUST NOT:

- Rename, abbreviate, pluralise, or rephrase the value
- "Normalise" case, separators, or extensions (e.g. `-` → `_`, `.md` → `.MD`)
- Relocate the file to a different directory because it "fits better" elsewhere
- Replace a prescribed token (e.g. `comm-test`) with a semantically similar one (e.g. `task-test`)
- Add a prefix, suffix, or timestamp unless the payload explicitly requests it

#### Conflict handling

If the prescribed filename conflicts with an existing file, do **not** auto-resolve by appending a suffix or generating a new name. Instead:

1. Do not write the file.
2. Write a query document to `project/queries/QUERY-<taskId>.md` describing the conflict (existing file's purpose, what you would write, your proposed resolution options).
3. Include the trailer `GateForge-Priority: BLOCKED` on the commit.
4. Push the branch. The host-side notifier will flag the Architect.
5. Wait for a follow-up task from the Architect before proceeding.

#### Self-check before every commit

Before `git add`, answer these three questions. If the answer to any is "no", do not commit — fix the filename first:

1. Does the exact string of my target path appear verbatim in the task payload?
2. Does the branch name match the payload's prescribed branch (or the role's documented naming pattern if no branch was specified)?
3. If the task prescribed a `commitSubject`, does my `git commit -m` begin with that exact string?
